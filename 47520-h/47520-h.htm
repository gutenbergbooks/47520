<p class="pc2">THANKSGIVING STUDIES</p>

<p class="p2">You often hear people talking of the President of
our country. Doubtless most of you know him by
name. Some of you may have seen him.</p>

<p>You also know that once in every four years we
have an election day, when papa votes for the man
whom he thinks best for President. Then the one
who gets the most votes becomes our President for
four years.</p>

<p>If this man makes a good President, he is sometimes
chosen again for another four years, or term,
as we call it. But if he has not pleased the people,
they choose some one else, anybody else, next election
day. We never know who will be our next President
until he is elected. One term he is a man from one
part of the country; the next term he may be one
from a far distant part. In our country we think
that this way is best.</p>

<p>It is not so in every country. In some countries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
instead of a president there is a king, who expects to
be king as long as he lives. At his death his son becomes
the king. If the king happens to be a good
one, it is well for the country and for the people; but
if he chances to be a wicked, cruel one, the poor people
have a sorry time as long as he lives.</p>

<p class="p2">When Sunday comes, John goes with his mamma
and papa to the Methodist Church. Perhaps Mary
goes with her parents to the Baptist. Gretchen may
prefer to go to the Lutheran Church, and Margaret
to the Roman Catholic. In our country we think
this quite right. We like to see people going to the
church that helps them most.</p>

<p>As it costs much money to build churches and pay
the preachers, people must give money or there can
be no churches. John may want to give his pennies
to the Methodist Church or Sunday-school. Mary
would rather give hers to the Baptist. Gretchen’s
money is given to the Lutheran, and Margaret’s to
the Roman Catholic. In our country we think this,
too, quite right. No one forces us to give money to
any church. When we have any to give, we may do
with it as we choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither is this true in all countries. In some lands
where there are kings instead of presidents, the
kings have sometimes said that all the people must go
to a certain church, and that they must pay that
church money. Some of the kings have forbidden
the people to have any other churches.</p>

<p>Sometimes there have been people who loved another
church which they were unwilling to give up.
Sometimes there have been kings who have put these
people in prison and done other harsh things in trying
to force them to worship God according to the
king’s will.</p>

<p class="p2">We shall learn of some unhappy people who lived
in a country ruled at times by just such hard-hearted
kings. When we know of some of the troubles and
great hardships through which they passed in trying
to pray to God and serve him as they thought
right, we shall surely love them and always remember
their noble deeds.</p>

<p>These people lived far across the Atlantic Ocean,
in a country called England, where the king and all
the people speak the English language. We learned
our English from them.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">CHILDREN OF CHARLES I</p>
</div></div>

<p>Look at the picture (Children of Charles I.) of
these three children with their pet dog. You can
tell that the dog is their playfellow and that he loves
them, by the way he has taken his place at their side,
and by the loving, trustful manner in which he looks
up into the face of the boy whose hand rests on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
head. The baby (Baby Stuart), whose picture
alone you often see, and whom you hear called “Baby
Stuart,” clasps a big red apple in his chubby hands.</p>

<p>These things would make us think that these are
ordinary children, just like you, with a love for fun
and frolic, and an eye for bright things and a taste
for goodies.</p>

<p>Let us look at their clothes. This picture is a copy
of a fine painting in rich colors. If we could go to
the big gallery where the painting hangs, we should
see that Mary, the sister, is dressed in beautiful white
satin; Charles, the elder brother, has on an elegant
scarlet gown; while the dear little baby, James, wears
a dainty blue gown. The quaint, rich dresses of
stiff, costly goods, covered with fine needle-work,
would convince us that these are not ordinary children.
Indeed, they are the children of a great king.</p>

<p>Charles and Mary and James lived three hundred
years ago. Their grandfather had been King of
England, and then their father was king. Next
Charles ruled his country, and finally James.</p>

<p>Their grandfather was one of the kings who tried
to force all of the people to go to one church and to
give their money to no other. He forbade them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
have a church of their own, and treated pretty
roughly those who would not obey him.</p>

<p>In one part of England there were a number of
people who did not like the church of the king’s
choice, and were set on having one that suited their
way of thinking. They had heard of another country,
just a little way across a small sea, where people
might go to any church that they liked. So they
left their good farms and fled from England to this
other country, called Holland, the home of the
Dutch<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Here everything seemed very strange to them.
There were no high hills in Holland. The land was
low, as the land sometimes is beside the creek or
down by the pond. In some places it was so low that
the sea came right up into some of the streets, and
when the people wished to leave their houses they
had to go down the street in row-boats. Of course,
the little children in those houses could not go out
to play, for there were no yards and the streets were
full of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of you boys have sometimes made little
dams, to dam up water along the ditch or slough.
That is what these Dutch people did. They built
dams (or dikes, as they called them) to keep the
water off the land, so that they might have farms
and cities.</p>

<p>Now the English who had come to Holland, having
left their farms and made new homes in a Dutch city,
found themselves without a way to make a living.
The Dutch neighbors all around them were great
workers. They worked steadily, and they worked
hard. The men all had some business or trade to
keep them busy. The women were fine housekeepers
and kept their houses clean and neat as a pin. They
were all careful and saving, and had ways of using
many things which some people throw away as useless.</p>

<p>When the English people had looked around, and
saw how things were, they made up their minds that
they must learn to work like the Dutch. Therefore,
they learned to spin wool into thread and yarn, to
weave cloth, to twist twine, to make rope, hats and
pipes, to build houses of either brick or lumber, and
to make tables, chairs and other pieces of furniture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
These are only a few of the things that the English
learned of the Dutch.</p>

<p>The English children saw much to interest them in
their queer new home. No doubt it seemed to them
a funny, funny place, with its low houses with little
window panes, its giant wind-mills scattered all
around the country, its odd dog carts, and its comical
little girls and boys. (1068. Girl with Cat.) This
picture shows us that the little girls wore long
dresses, and caps with curious ornaments on the sides
of their heads. Like most of the people in that country,
this little maid wore wooden shoes. These she
hung up in an orderly manner every night, and she
always scrubbed them well on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Dutch children were very kind to the little
English boys and girls, and, you may be sure, played
with them whenever they had a chance. What do
you think the stranger children learned from their
new playmates? They soon learned to talk in Dutch,
and to act like their Dutch comrades.</p>

<p>The English fathers and mothers did not like that.
They still loved England, and English ways, and the
English language. Their love for their old home
country made them grieve to see their children forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
it. Therefore, they began to think of moving
again. They said to themselves: “We can not
stay here any longer. Before long our children and
grandchildren will be like the Dutch. Our young
men and young women will be marrying the Dutch.
We must go somewhere else, where we can stay always
and still be Englishmen.”</p>

<p>Long before this, people had sailed across the Atlantic
Ocean to this country which we now call America.
Those who stayed here wrote letters home, and
those who went back told their friends of this vast
country, with miles and miles of good rich lands.
They told of the great woods, of the high mountains
and wide rivers, of the plentiful supply of wild berries
and nuts, and of the fish, wild ducks, rabbits, and
deer that could be used for food.</p>

<p>Only Indians had been living here up to that time.
These red men wandered about from place to place,
stopping when they pleased, now here, now there,
wherever they could find plenty to eat for a time.
When they came to a place where they wished to
camp, they would cut some poles, stand them up, and
cover them with skins to form tents. This picture
of a Comanche Indian Camp (1343) shows how an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Indian village looks. The Arapahoe Indian Camp
(1342) gives a nearer view of one of the tents, and we
can see how the skins are pieced together and
stretched to make a covering.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">COMANCHE INDIAN CAMP</p>
</div></div>

<p>In both pictures are shown some of the Indians
themselves wrapped in their blankets. In the second
picture at the opening of the tent we see a little
Indian child with no blanket on. A short distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
away there is a fresh skin hung over a pole to
dry.</p>

<p>The English people in Holland had heard that in
this great country there was plenty of room, with no
cruel kings. They thought that if they could only
get here they could build themselves houses, and have
a church to suit them, and pray and live as they
thought right. Every day they thought more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
more how much better it would be if they could come
to this new country and have a home of their own.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">DEPARTURE OF THE PILGRIMS FROM DELFT HAVEN</p>
</div></div>

<p>Although they did not have much money, they
managed finally to get two ships in which to sail
across the ocean to America. And here you see a
picture of the Pilgrims, as these people have ever
since been called, starting for their new home. (1331.
C. Departure of the Pilgrims from Delft Haven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
1620. Cope.) The quaint houses, row-boats, and great
wind-mills give you an idea of what Holland is
like. Lying in the harbor is one of the waiting ships.
Because the water is not deep enough, she can not
come close to the shore; so a row-boat must take the
people out to her. A boat full is now ready to be
pushed off.</p>

<p>All can not go this time. Some must stay in Holland.
The people on the shore have brought their
dear Bible with them and at this moment are kneeling
in prayer, doubtless asking God to care for their
friends and relatives and lead them safely across the
deep waters.</p>

<p>In the picture called “Embarkation of the Pilgrims”
(1331. Weir) we see that the Pilgrims now
aboard, starting off, also have the Bible with them,
and that there are prayers upon their lips as they
leave the people who have been so kind to them and
the little country that has given them a quiet home
so long.</p>

<p>After they had started out the Pilgrims found
that one of their ships, called the Speedwell, was not
strong enough for so long and dangerous a voyage.
They sailed into an English harbor, and tried to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the ship put in order. But they found she could not
be made sound. So all that could crowded into the
other ship, the Mayflower, and the rest of the band
had to be left in England.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-016.jpg" width="450" height="341"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">EMBARKATION OF THE PILGRIMS</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was not until September that the Pilgrims were
really on their way. Although it was later in the
season than they had wished to start, and they knew
that many storms were likely to come upon them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
nevertheless, they sailed off in the Mayflower with
brave and cheerful hearts.</p>

<p>For about two months&mdash;long, long months&mdash;they
sailed, sailed, sailed, with nothing in sight but water,
water, water, water. The weather was growing
colder; there were sometimes storms, and the people
were very uncomfortable. Some of them fell ill.
One man died.</p>

<p>They were so crowded in the cabins that they suffered
for want of air. They did not have water
enough to keep their clothes and themselves clean.
There was not room for the children to run about in
their play, as they liked to do, and the long, tiresome
voyage was hard for them to bear.</p>

<p>One day, when the ship was in mid ocean, a new
baby, whom the Pilgrims called Oceanus, came. Now
they had something to interest them. Doubtless
they loved him instantly, liked to peep into his
little red face at every chance, were glad to hold him
when they might, and talked with one another about
him.</p>

<p>Finally, late in November, the Mayflower came in
sight of land. There had been more and more sickness
among the Pilgrims, and the weather was stormy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and cold. They were miserable on the ship, and yet
on land they would be more miserable still. There
were no houses, no place for them to go. What were
the poor wanderers to do?</p>


<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-018.jpg" width="450" height="230"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">THE MAYFLOWER IN PLYMOUTH HARBOR</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Mayflower sailed as near to the shore as she
could get, as we see her in this picture (1331. B. The
Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor), while a party of
men went ashore to hunt a good landing place. They
wanted to find a neighborhood where there was a
spring of fresh water, plenty of trees that might be
chopped down for the building of houses, and open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
fields where grain might be raised. It took them
several weeks to find such a place.</p>

<p>One day, while wandering around, they came to a
spot where something had been buried. Digging
down, they found some maize, or Indian corn, which
had been hidden there. Although they had caught
fish along the shore, and had shot game in the woods,
the food that they brought to America with them was
fast being eaten up. So they looked upon this maize
as a treasure. The finders promptly decided to
carry it to the ship and pay the owner when they
should find him.</p>

<p>It was almost Christmas before the Pilgrims decided
on the spot to begin their new home, which was
to be called Plymouth. The men all went to work,
chopping down trees and shaping logs for a building
in which all could live together until they could build
more houses. When this was ready, just a few days
before Christmas, they brought the women and children
ashore.</p>

<p>In this picture (1332. Landing of the Pilgrims)
one painter has shown us what kind of a day he
thought it was. The skies are dark, the wind is
blowing hard, and the waves are rough. The men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pull the boat close to a rock, and hold her steady
while the wanderers step upon it.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This rock has ever since been called Plymouth
Rock, and it has been kept and carefully guarded
through all the many, many years that have passed
since the Pilgrims first stepped upon it. Here is a
picture of the actual rock, which we all love so well.
(1333. Plymouth Rock.) So many thoughtless
people broke off bits for keepsakes that it was necessary
to build an iron railing around it so that it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
not be reached. That has been taken away now. If
you some day have a chance to visit Plymouth, you
will see that a fine marble arch has been built over it.</p>

<p>Now came many troubles and hardships. The
weather was bitterly cold, and the Pilgrims were
without comfortable homes in which to keep warm.
They had not enough of the right kind of food. So
many of them were sick that the second house which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was put up was needed for a hospital. Then there
were the Indians, of whom they stood in constant
fear.</p>

<p>The men chose for their captain the brave Miles
Standish, who had proved himself a good soldier and
captain while in Holland. He drilled them so that
they might be ready to fight the red men if necessary.</p>

<p>A friendly young Indian named Hobomok came to
live with the Pilgrims. As he knew all about the Indians
and the country, he was of great help to them.
(1340. Miles Standish and His Soldiers.) Here
you see Captain Standish and some of his soldiers
following the faithful Hobomok, who is showing
them the way.</p>

<p>As they never knew what moment the Indians
would come upon them, even when they went to
church the Pilgrims carried their guns. (1339. Pilgrims
Going to Church.) A fine picture showing a
group on the way to church, has been painted for us.
You see a copy of it here. The man in the long gown
and carrying a Bible, is the elder who will lead the
services. Several others have their Bibles in their
hands, but the men all carry guns. When they reach
the meeting-house the guns will be kept close at hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The same artist has painted another picture showing
us that even when a young man takes his sweetheart
to meeting, he must have his gun upon his shoulder
(1337. John Alden and Priscilla), while she carries
her Bible.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Have you noticed that in all of the pictures in
which it has been possible to put a Bible, the different
painters have given the Book a prominent place?
Do you understand why? Because the noble Pilgrims
had great love for God. They lived a life of
loyal trust in him. Not only on Sundays, but every
day they loved to read the Bible and pray. And so
that they might pray to God and serve him as they
wished they gave up kind friends and comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
homes and risked their very lives. We should not
think a picture of our Pilgrim forefathers good unless
it made us think as soon as we saw it of this part
of their lives.</p>

<p>One hundred and two Pilgrims had come to America
on the Mayflower. By spring half of the little
band had died. The first to go was the beautiful
young wife of Captain Standish. Another and another
followed. Little Oceanus and his mother both
died. There were so many sick that at one time
there were only seven who were able to wait upon the
others. For fear that the Indians would find out
how small their number was becoming, when the Pilgrims
buried those who died, they would not make
mounds above the graves, but smoothed them over.</p>

<p>In April the Mayflower set sail for England. Now
was a chance for the people to go back to their old
home. How many do you think wished to go? In
spite of all the trials and sorrows which they had
seen, in spite of the hard times that would surely
come to them in this new country, not one sailed in
the Mayflower except the sailors who manned the
ship!</p>

<p>Still, the sailing of the ship made the Pilgrims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
think of the many loved ones across the water, and
without doubt they watched with sorrowful faces
and weeping eyes, as long as the Mayflower could
be seen. (1334. Departure of the Mayflower.
Bayes.)</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Pilgrims had learned how to manage farm
lands, and how to support their families in a large
city. Now they had to lead a new and quite different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
life in a wild, strange land. It was well for them, indeed,
that among their Indian neighbors there were
some who were willing to be their friends. These
friendly red men understood life in the wilds, and
showed the white people how to make snow-shoes,
moccasins, canoes, and other useful articles. From
the Indians the white men also learned how to catch
eels and how to trap animals. When planting time
came, it was a friendly Indian named Squanto who
showed them how to plant their maize and tend it so
as to get good crops.</p>

<p>Their peas and some of their other crops did not
do so very well the first season; but in the autumn it
was found that there was a fine harvest of maize.
This filled their hearts with joy.</p>

<p>While living in Holland the Pilgrims had seen
the Dutch keep a Thanksgiving day every autumn.
The people of Plymouth thought that after their
crops had been gathered and their hard work was finished
for the season, it would be a good thing for
them to have a time of joy and thanksgiving. So
Governor Bradford sent out a company of men to
shoot wild turkeys and other game, and the women
set to work to cook all sorts of good things, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
they might feast and frolic for a week. He sent an
invitation to the Indian neighbors to enjoy the fun
with them.</p>

<p>Wishing to show their good will, and to help with
the Thanksgiving feast, the Indian guests went into
the woods and killed for the table five deer and much
other game. As the Pilgrims had not yet become
skilled enough hunters to get much large game, they
were very grateful for this present from their
friends.</p>

<p>About ninety Indians came with their chief. They
stayed for three days. The time was passed in
wrestling, shooting at marks, and in other sports.
By the time the party was over there was a better
feeling between the reds and the whites, and it
seemed that they might afterward live in peace.</p>

<p>By the end of a year the people had built seven
houses for homes, and four other buildings for the
use of all. But their worries and sufferings were by
no means ended. Other ships came from England
with many people but no food. The Pilgrims could
not raise enough grain to make bread for all.</p>

<p>There were plenty of fish, clams, oysters, and lobsters
in the sea; and wild grapes, plums, and berries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in the woods. Yet during the next two years the
people of Plymouth sometimes could scarcely keep
from starving. For four months, at one time, they
lived almost entirely upon sea food. Only once in a
while could they find some nuts or shoot some game
in the woods.</p>

<p>During those trying days all that the Pilgrims had
learned in Holland helped them a great deal. When
they reached this country, before they could do anything
else, they needed to make tool handles and get
their tools ready for work.</p>

<p>The ship was small and crowded, and so it was not
possible to bring all the furniture and the hundreds
of articles, both little and large, which they would
really need. They had to make not only their houses,
but all these other things as quickly as possible.
There were no mills, no stores, no shops; they could
not run down town to get every little thing needed.</p>

<p>Finally their clothes began to wear out. What
could they do? In Holland they had learned from
the Dutch women to raise flax and spin it into beautiful
even threads, and later to weave these threads
into good linen cloth. (The Spinner. Maes.) So
now the Pilgrims raised flax and sheep, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
winter time, when there was not much other work to
do, the women busied themselves spinning flax and
wool into thread and yarn, which they dyed themselves.
This thread and yarn they wove into cloth
and knit up into warm stockings and mittens.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">PRISCILLA SPINNING</p>
</div></div>

<p>(3298. Priscilla Spinning. Barse.) In this
picture we see a Puritan maiden sitting near the cozy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
fireplace, spinning with a spinning wheel which she
runs with her foot. She has her Bible in her lap,
probably so that she may once in a while read a verse
or two to be thinking about as she works.</p>

<p>Thus we might talk on and on, without being able
to tell all about the Pilgrim forefathers and foremothers
and what we owe them. Stories and poems
have been written about them, and artists of many
countries have painted us beautiful pictures of them.
We can not look over the books in any good library
without finding much about the brave and upright,
God-loving Pilgrims. We can not go into any of the
large galleries where hang rows and rows of fine
paintings, and not see pictures of Pilgrim scenes.
As you grow older you will hear more and more of
them.</p>

<p>Some day you may be able to go to Plymouth, the
very town which these brave people began to build almost
three hundred years ago. There you will have
pointed out to you the very Plymouth Rock on which
they landed; perhaps you will visit Burial Hill,
where sleep their noble dead; you will see the first
street laid out, the spot where the first house was
built, and the monument erected to the Pilgrims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>’
memory. The townspeople will take pride in telling
you how long it took to build the marble giant, and
how much money it cost.</p>

<p>They will direct you to Pilgrim Hall, which is
filled with things which were once used by the Pilgrims,
or have something to do with them. Here you
may see among other things a chest and a chair which
once belonged to Elder Brewster, whose black-gowned
figure we see in so many pictures, Governor
Carver’s chair, a dinner pot, and the sword of Miles
Standish. Here, too, hang a number of the Pilgrim
pictures, which our country wishes to keep forever,
if possible.</p>

<p class="pc4 lmid">SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</p>

<div class="reduct">

<p class="p2">Take plenty of time. The first of November is none too soon
to begin.</p>

<p>Tell a little each day, showing but one picture at one lesson (excepting
pictures which are in some way closely related; as, for
instance, the Comanche and the Arapahoe Indian Camps, which are
but different views of everyday Indian life).</p>

<p>When a point which can be illustrated has been made, show the
picture. In getting out of the picture what she can for the children,
each teacher must use her own good judgment considering the grade
and general intelligence of her class.</p>

<p>After it has been handled to the best possible advantage, hang
the picture low on the wall, where it will be convenient for the
pupils to look at it at odd times. When another has been introduced,
hang it near. By the time the story is ended, the entire
series will be on display.</p>

<p>Encourage pupils to look at them before sessions, at intermissions,
and at other chance times. They will do it; and without the class
restraint, will examine them together, and will give the teacher
opportunities to talk with them in small groups. In this way, the
children may be led to form the beginning of worthy acquaintances.
When later and in other places they come across these same
pictures, their faces will light up as at sight of old friends.</p>

<p>After the story has been well told in parts, tell or read it as a
whole at least once,&mdash;twice or thrice is better.</p>

<p>As, in both content and vocabulary, there is much in the story
that is new for ordinary public school little ones, it is more
profitable for teachers, especially of the lowest primary grades, to
use the time in repeating the story over and over, until the tale
and the expressions have been caught, before demanding much oral
reproduction in class. If the child is attracted, it will without
conscious effort absorb, and more will come from the work than is
in evidence in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>As to the pictures,&mdash;so that they are good copies, it matters not
whence they come. Among those which I am using are some
sent out with Sunday city papers, educational and other publications,
a few magazine illustrations, and the Perry pictures. Numbers
in this work refer to the Perry catalogue.</p>

<p>Gray is a serviceable color, does no violence to the eyes, and
brings out the tones well. For these reasons, gray cardboard
makes a good mounting.</p></div>
